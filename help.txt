*** Simpletron Help ***

The Simpletron is a hypothetical computer that runs programs written in Simpletron Machine Language (SML).
You can enter SML instructions to create programs that the Simpletron will execute.

Basic Instructions:
- Each instruction must be a signed 4-digit integer.
- The first two digits represent the operation code (opcode).
- The last two digits represent the operand (memory address to operate on).

Special Commands:
- Enter -99999 to stop entering your program and start execution.
- Enter 'help' at any time to display this help message.

Operations Supported:
- 10: READ - Read input and store it in a memory address.
- 11: WRITE - Output the value stored in a memory address.
- 20: LOAD - Load a value from a memory address into the accumulator.
- 21: STORE - Store the value in the accumulator into a memory address.
- 30: ADD - Add a value from a memory address to the accumulator.
- 31: SUBTRACT - Subtract a value from a memory address from the accumulator.
- 32: DIVIDE - Divide the accumulator by a value from a memory address.
- 33: MULTIPLY - Multiply the accumulator by a value from a memory address.
- 34: MOD - Perform modulus operation on the accumulator with a value from a memory address.
- 35: EXP - Raise the accumulator to the power of a value from a memory address.
- 36: NEWLINE - Print a newline character.
- 40: BRANCH - Set the instruction counter to a specific memory address.
- 41: BRANCH_IF_ZERO - Branch if the accumulator is zero.
- 42: BRANCH_IF_NEGATIVE - Branch if the accumulator is negative.
- 43: HALT - Stop program execution.

Example Program to Add Two Numbers:
00 ? +1007  (READ input into address 07)
01 ? +1008  (READ input into address 08)
02 ? +2007  (LOAD from address 07)
03 ? +3008  (ADD value at address 08)
04 ? +2109  (STORE result in address 09)
05 ? +1109  (WRITE value at address 09)
06 ? +4300  (HALT the program)

To test the program, you will be prompted to enter numbers after the program is loaded.

Enjoy using Simpletron!
